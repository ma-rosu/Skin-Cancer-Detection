# Skin-Cancer-Detection

The project does not come with the AI trained, you have to train it yourself.

There are 2 scripts, one train.py and one use.py. 
With the train.py script you have to train the AI once you got the data-set.
With the use.py script you have to train the AI once you trained the AI.

For the data set used go on kaggle and download it: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000
